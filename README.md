# The Self-Improving Framework

A **Framework** for building **Self-Improving** and **Self-Creating** LLM agents.

This repository contains two core components:

1. **The Generic Framework**: A domain agnostic, event-driven engine designed to simulate high-stakes environments where diverse AI agents must navigate conflicting goals, reflect, adapt, and autonomously architect entirely new agents to break systemic deadlocks.
2. **The US-Iran Case Study**: A specific geopolitical simulation implemented using the framework to gauge its effectiveness in a highly polarized, multi-agent adversarial setting.
